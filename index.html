  	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello, My name is Brittni Wright (born November 14), I am a person in pursuit of changing my career path. I have a B.S. degree in economics and business administration from East Carolina University.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some interesting facts about me is that I was the face for Gerber baby food commercials for the first 7 monthes of my life, so I have been in the work force since I came out of the womb!! As a child growing up I excelled in many sports and activities such as soccer, basketball, and cheerleading. I got hit in the face playing basketball and was forced to have a reconstructive nose job so I would not go through life disfigured (according to my mother) but at the time that it happened I think I was more concerned that my WNBA dreams were crushed.  
		</p>
		<p>
			As a young adult I have been blessed to try many different roles and careers. For example, as I was enjoying spring break in Miami, Fl, one day I was enjoying tapas with my friends when I saw Cuba Gooding Jr. walking the strip and He stopped and asked me if I wanted to be a cast member in one of his films, of course, I accepted and starred as choir member #4(nonspeaking role) in a moving called "Fighting Temtations." 
		</p>
		<p>
			Moreover, in the last year I have relocate to Raleigh, NC and been introduced to the world of coding through sheer curiosity and a true grit to learn. For the past 7 months I have been teaching myself and working with local hackers on parol that offer me feedback when hI need help. I look forward to learning as much as I can in this program so that I too can give back.  
		</p>
